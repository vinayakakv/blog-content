title: Across the Mountains
date: 2022-03-12
excerpt: A story of the journey across the tallest, biodiverse Western Ghat mountains of Karnataka.
---

I always love to travel across the mountains for several reasons -- they are beautiful to look at, they host a plethora of flora and fauna, their elevation and valleys give a chance to sight more mountains nearby and far away, and they have long fostered different cultures and belief by isolating groups of people -- all of which I get a chance to observe. In [one of my earlier posts](/writings/mountain-hunt "/writings/mountain-hunt"), I wrote about the experience of traveling to _Mysore_ from my native while capturing most of the top-10 peaks of Karnataka. I recently traveled across the same route. Fortunately, the [PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels](/writings/missing-mountains "/writings/missing-mountains") in the air were low, enabling viewing longer distances. After two days, I returned on a different path, seeing a different range of mountains. This is the story of both routes, combined with the photographs of mountains and learnings of geography, forests, and agriculture along the way.

## Let's Begin! -- The Home

I'm situated in the Central Western Ghats, near the [Kuduremukha mountain range](/writings/untamed-horse "/writings/untamed-horse"). The mountain range features _shola_ forests â€“ a grassland-forest complex. Atop some 1860m height, the _Kuduremukha_ peak, the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest in _Karnataka_, is home to montane evergreen forests and grasslands. The mountain is clearly visible from my house, so it was the first photo of the day! Although it is hot and sunny in March and most of the grass is dry and brown, we still see some green patches of grass, thanks to the moisture content in the air and the forests capturing them. While the forest cover in the last layer of mountains (the _Kuduremukha_ peak) is native, some of the green covers in the subsequent layers of mountains are due to introduced tree species, now invasive in some regions.

My native, _Kalasa_, is located in a small plain land surrounded by hills and mountains in all directions. They were grassland-forest complexes [around 50 years ago](/writings/corona-dataset "/writings/corona-dataset"), now occupied by introduced species and coffee plantations. Patches of evergreen forests survive today, with some deciduous trees in between.

## The First Ascent

The journey slowly takes us towards the core Western Ghats bordering the coast, resulting in an ascent. This is due to the Western Ghats' gentle slope towards the east. During the ascent, we see a lot of Coffee, Tea, and Areca Nut plantations spreading across the mountains, for which the _Chikkamagalur_ district is famous. The _Kuduremukha_ mountain is still seen behind some of the mountains, although the peak is obscured along the way.

The colorful broad trees are the evergreen forest, with pale green-colored patches of introduced Acacia trees."

/>

Soon, we arrive at a relatively flat mountain plain. This place is rightfully named _Hirebylu_ (lit. the large plain, as per the mountain standards ðŸ˜…â€‹â€‹). It is situated near the _Mallarasana Gudda_ hill, filled with Coffee plantations, some under the native forest canopy.

/>

Then, the terrain quickly changes within a kilometer (yeah, this is a mountain plain, that too, a big one!), and we find ourselves at a slope of the core Western Ghat mountains. Being at that elevation gives a breathtaking view of a short plain, followed by _Chandradrona_ mountains, an interior extension of Western Ghats (such extensions in the inland are rare across the Western Ghats).

  type="PANORAMA"
/>

Since _Chandradrona_ mountains rise from the plateau, as opposed to the core Western Ghats, which arise from coastal plains, they are at a higher altitude. The _Mullayyanagiri_ Peak and the _Bababudangiri_, a part of this mountain chain, are the first and second highest mountains in Karnataka.

  caption="The _Mullayyanagiri peak_ is the highest point in the last layer of mountains."

/>

The Coffee plantations on the way still preserve some native, evergreen trees that were a part of a larger tropical jungle. Some trees bear colorful leaves during Feb-April as they grow new foliage. The pre-monsoon showers accompanied by thunderstorms help to sustain their new growth. The trees with fresh foliage are a sight to behold and enjoy.

/>

Continuing in the route, we see _Mertiparvata_, the 6<sup>th</sup> highest peak in Karnataka. Its name "_Merti_" seems to be derived from a holy mountain in Hindu and Buddhist mythology with 5 peaks. The _Angkor Wat_ temple complex is also said to resemble the peaks of the mythological _Merti_ mountain. Suiting the mythical characteristics, the _Mertiparvata_ also has 5 peaks, of which only 2 are visible in _Kalasa_. We see a beautiful view of all of its sharp peaks in this route.

We also see the cliff-mountain, _Ballarayana Durga_, which hosted a fort (_Durga_) of _Hoysala_ kings based out of the same region and then expanded their territory to the plains. This fort was their last resort when the Sultans of Delhi attacked and ruined their kingdom.

We then come across the British-era _Kelagur_ tea plantation, spreading across several mountains.

We also see the bordering Western Ghats, with plantations on one side and forest and grassland on the other.

  type="NORMAL"
/>

As we inch towards _Kottigehara_, the plains in between the mountains become much more prominent. The Western Ghats confine themselves to the border regions, and fewer mountains are seen after them. This is a regular trend in the Western Ghats, with some exceptions, as in _Kalasa_ region and _Coorg_. While the plain lands were evergreen forests earlier, they were long converted into agricultural farmlands. Now the mountain forests are also encroached by Coffee plantations!

## Across the Mountain Plains

After _Kottigehara_, the plains become much broader, making the sight of the mountains rare. We still see some mountains at a distance, at the bordering Western Ghats. Apart from them, there are some smaller hills here and there. A mountain with power lines atop catches our attention moving through this route.

If we look back at the path from which we came, we still see the bordering Western Ghats, standing majestically.

Soon, we reach _Mudigere_, situated at a slightly higher elevation than its surroundings. I knew that we could see _Mertiparvata_ from _Mudigere_ at a 36km Line of Sight distance while navigating Google Earth. However, I wasn't sure of the weather conditions and obstructions. I was fortunate to view _Mertiparvata_ directly from the _Mudigere_ bus stand (actually, from its restroom ðŸ˜‚â€‹â€‹). When I was a child, I remember seeing it earlier and being told that I was mad at that mountain to see it everywhere ðŸ˜…. Photographing it provided solid proof and satisfaction!

  type="FULL_WIDTH"
/>

The regular route from _Mudigere_ to _Mysore_ operates through _Belur_ and _Hasana_, which fall entirely in the plains. I was not ready to give up the mountains so early in my journey, so I de-boarded the bus and headed towards _Sakaleshapura_, a town similar in geography to _Mudigere_. Surprisingly, a monkey was collecting food to eat from the passengers on the bus, as humans would beg money. However, when the bus engine started, the monkey ran away -- It knew the business very well!

The route from _Mudigere_ to _Sakaleshapur_ passes through several coffee plantations and small hills. The land here is not as plain as it is along the route from _Kottigehara_ to _Mudigere_. We encounter several hills along the way.

/>

Just around 8km before _Sakaleshapura_, one can see a majestic view of _Kumaraparvata_, the 5<sup>th</sup> highest peak of Karnataka. This view is rare, as the mountain is covered with clouds during monsoons, and air quality is poor during other times. Although I knew about the visibility of the _Kumaraparvata_ from that place, I had never seen it. Once, when traveling in a crowded bus, I remember seeing something and disregarding it as an illusion. I was happy and heartfelt to see the illusion manifest itself as reality.

Apart from the _Kumaraparvata_, we see other mountains from the same place, which I was familiar with earlier.

After reaching _Sakaleshapura_, I had a choice of going back to _Hasan_ in the plains to reach _Mysore_. In fact, I took this several times when I was de-routing from the regular route for the first few times. However, we still can stay in the mountains for some time by heading to _Somavarapete_ in the _Coorg_. One has to be careful about the route, though -- the route via _Shanivarasante_ does not pass through as many mountains as the route through _Hettur_-_Mageri_. In fact, I learned about the difference between these routes the hard way by making mistakes and going to _Somavarapete_ via *Shanivarasante*â€‹â€‹.

## The Second Ascent

Once we depart _Sakaleshapura_ and head towards _Somavarapete_, we are back at the mountains. I remember seeing a long chain of mountains, probably _Chandradrona_. But I couldn't verify it as I missed taking a photograph. We also see a long chain of bordering Western Ghats as soon as we pass the entrance of the _Shiradi Ghat_.

In no time, as we near towards the _Vanagoor Kudurasthe_, where the 3 roads meet, we start seeing _Kumaraparvata_ again. One may have trouble recognizing it, as it appears in an entirely different shape than as seen before _Sakaleshapura_. This is because we are now much nearer to it.

<IndexedImage

  index={20}

The route moving forward from _Kudurasthe_ is scenic and beautiful. There are several beautiful and rocky mountains, with grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, and agricultural lands all combined.

Soon, we reach the entrance of the _Bisle Ghat_ road, which descends near the coastal town of _Kukke_ _Subramanya_, situated directly below the _Kumaraparvata_. The route to _Somavarapete_ now heads parallel to the bordering Western Ghats covered with evergreen forests, reminding me of the [_Bhagavati_ forest](/writings/the-wall "/writings/the-wall") in the _Kuduremukha_ Range.

As the _Somavarapete_ region is situated at a higher altitude than its surroundings, the route starts to ascend and descend the mountains while maintaining an overall elevation gain. Just 8km before _Somavarapete_, we reach a calm and beautiful village situated aside a mountain, _Shantalli_. Surprisingly, the literal meaning of its name resonates well with the current description that I just mentioned. We get a beautiful view of humans living alongside nature there.

The town of _Somavarapete_ is situated atop a hill, offering an excellent view of nearby mountains. The view of _Kotebetta_, the 7<sup>th</sup> highest peak in Karnataka, captures anyone's eyes, as it has a steep cliff at its one side.

We still see _Kumaraparvata_, although several of its foothills obscure its view. Without the help of Google Earth, I couldn't have recognized it.

## Goodbye, Mountains!

At _Somavarapete_, I can still travel across the mountains by either going to _Madikeri_ or _Virajapete_. However, they would make my journey to _Mysore_ more elongated and deviate me from the direction of _Mysore_. Thus, heading to the plains is the only option left. Leaving behind _Somavarapete_ and heading towards _Kushalanagar_, the elevation slowly decreases, and the characteristics of the forests gradually turn from evergreen to deciduous.

<IndexedImage

  index={26}
  caption="Semi-evergreen forest seen near _Somavarapete_, moving towards _Kushalanagara_."

The deciduous forest during March-April is arid, and the trees are leafless. Teak trees constitute a significant part of these forests.

  index={27}
  caption="Teak trees in the deciduous forests near _Kushalanagara_."

Although the landscape is generally dry, the agricultural lands still grow the crop, thanks to the irrigation system constituted by the _Harangi_ reservoir.

As we near _Kushalanagar_, we see _Harangi_ river, outflowing from its reservoir, which soon confluences with the _Kaveri_ River. The _Kaveri_ River constitutes the border between the districts of _Mysore_ and _Coorg_. At the _Kushalanagar_, it is entirely plain land.

## At the Plains

The journey between _Kushalanagar_ and _Mysore_ passes through the long-stretching plains. These plains are not entirely _plain_ but have slight elevation differences of a few meters across large distances. Several small, rocky hillocks raise, seemingly out of nowhere. The _Chamundi betta_ of Mysore is significantly more giant out of these hillocks.

  type="NORMAL"
/>

The plains also host several lakes, some fed by the river canals constructed from the reservoirs, some others by the rainwater. The canals and lakes have enabled the farmers of the plains to grow paddy multiple times a year and adopt farming crops with enormous water demands like Areca nut and Black pepper. In some regions, growing Coffee is also being experimented with!

## Back to the Mountains

Staying a day in _Mysore_, I returned to my native by choosing a different route to see the _Chandradrona_ mountains more closely. This route passes through _Hasana_ and _Chikkamagaluru_ situated in the plains.

The hillocks of the plains provide an excellent opportunity to harness wind power, which is abundant there since there are no large mountains to obstruct and change the wind patterns. The wind energy farms are seen near the stretch of the route from _Hasana_ to _Belur_.

  index={32}
  caption="Wind energy towers situated atop a hillock near the plains of _Belur_."

In _Belur_, one can see the _Chandradrona_ mountains on a clear day. As we move towards _Chikkamagaluru_, the mountains become nearer and clearly visible. Out of this range, the sharp peak of _Devirammana Betta_ is attention-grabbing.

Although _Mullayyanagiri_ is also seen in this route, it does not stand out from its neighbors, as it is blended with other mountains of the range.

The city of _Chikkamagaluru_ is situated at the base of the _Chandradrona_ mountains, although it is still in the plains. We can see the mountains often obscured by man-made features such as buildings passing through the city.

Leaving _Chikkamagaluru_ behind and towards _Balehonnur_, after some 20km, we are back at the mountains. These mountains are extensively covered by the coffee plantations, with some patches of the deciduous forests reserved.

<IndexedImage

Along the route, one can witness the majestic look of rocky side ranges of _Chandradrona_, covered majorly with deciduous forests and grasslands.

Slowly, the forests turn into a mix of evergreen and deciduous, similar to _Somavarapete_. But, the terrain of the deciduous forests near _Chikkamagaluru_ is much more mountainous.

  index={38}

The deciduous forests here are composed chiefly of Teak trees, as they are near _Somavarapete_. In fact, it is tough to guess the location of these forests by looking at the photographs.

As we reach _Balehonnur_, we are greeted by the sight of the tail of _Chandradrona_ mountain at one side, the _Mertiparvata_ at the other side. My journey to my native is towards the _Mertiparvata_, and the forests there, are evergreen again.

## Concluding Remarks

A journey like this on a bus is exhausting and time-consuming. Although beneficial for capturing photos, the last seat of the bus hurts. In fact, things like being hit by the window frame dragged aside and thrown away are not uncommon ðŸ˜…â€‹â€‹. However, they say that any beautiful thing does not come without suffering. That's true in my case. I even had to be specific about the side of the window seat and exchange it with other passengers to capture some mountains!

This travel gave me a lot of understanding about the differences in the mountain terrains, forests, plantations, and cultures. Although much of the forests of the Western Ghats is now converted into monoculture Coffee, Tea, and Areca Nut plantations, it is saddening to see the encroaching and deforestation of the remaining forests. The effects the land development and construction works seem to be devastating.

Although, after growing the crops at the cost of nature, the farmers of the Western ghats suffer to get reasonable yields and then gain a good price at the market. While the [Kasturirangan Report](http://uttarakannada.nic.in/docs/Publication/HLWGWESTERNGHATSVOLUME1.pdf "http://uttarakannada.nic.in/docs/Publication/HLWGWESTERNGHATSVOLUME1.pdf") encourages creating special markets and brands for the crops of the Western ghats, it is funny that the people oppose it without reading the report, mentioning that they will be evacuated from their lands. **The people should listen to scientists, not politicians!**

The farmers of the plains are at an advantage here. Their crops thrive with the reservoirs constructed across the rivers originating at the Western Ghats. They are also experimenting and finding success in the crops native to the Western Ghats -- Areca Nut, Black Pepper, and Cardamom, by controlled irrigation. These crops in the Western Ghats are now failing due to the extended rains -- a direct consequence of Climate change.

The Western Ghat mountains are geographically older than the Himalayas. Its tropical forests and grasslands constitute a global biodiversity hotspot. Our duty and responsibility are to think scientifically and sustainably, and, protect the mountain ecology and live with it. The people outside the Western Ghats must think before asking to construct dams to fetch them water, railroads to have fun trips to mountains and temples, and cable cars to fly above the forests -- they are just money-making ventures for the constructors and politicians, and a permanent damage to the mountains and their ecology.
